# 2ndscreen

A software second screen for macOS. 2ndscreen creates a virtual display
with no hardware behind it, so an agent can work in apps placed there
while you keep using your own screen. Swipe to its full-screen preview to
watch, and move windows on and off it from the menu bar.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later (developed on macOS 15, Apple silicon)
- Xcode Command Line Tools, for `swift build`

## Build and run

```bash
./scripts/bundle-app.sh        # builds build/2ndscreen.app
open build/2ndscreen.app
```

The script signs the app with a self-signed certificate it creates in a
dedicated keychain (`~/Library/Keychains/2ndscreen-signing.keychain-db`).
macOS ties permission grants to that certificate, so they survive rebuilds.

## Permissions

| Permission | Needed for | Asked when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screen Recording | The live preview | You choose **Show Preview** |
| Accessibility | Moving other apps' windows | You choose **Grant Accessibility to Move Windows…** |

macOS applies a new Screen Recording grant after the app relaunches.

## Using it

Everything lives in the menu bar icon:

- **Virtual Display**: turn the display on or off. Turning it off moves
  its windows back to your other displays.
- **Resolution**: pick **Match … Full Screen** to size the display to
  the area a full-screen window gets on that real display, so the
  full-screen preview shows it pixel for pixel. Fixed presets are below.
- **HiDPI (Retina)**: render at 2x.
- **Show Preview / Keep Preview on Top / Preview in Full Screen**: a live
  view of the display. In full screen it gets its own Space, reachable with
  a trackpad swipe. Capture pauses while the preview cannot be seen.
- **Move Front Window to Other Screen** (⌃⌥⌘M, works anywhere): send the
  focused window to 2ndscreen, or bring it back if it is already there.
- **Windows on 2ndscreen**: bring one window, or all of them, back.

The preview is view-only: clicks in it do not reach the apps on 2ndscreen.

## Agent cursor

Agents act through accessibility and per-process events, so the real
pointer never moves. To show where an agent acts, 2ndscreen draws its own
cursor on the virtual display, visible in the preview:

```bash
.build/release/vdisplay cursor click 2400 500   # global point, top-left origin
.build/release/vdisplay cursor hide
```

`scripts/agent-click.py` combines this with a background click through
[cua-driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua):

```bash
scripts/agent-click.py --pid 1234 --window-id 5678 --text "Send"
```

## Command-line display

`vdisplay` creates a display without the app, for scripting:

```bash
swift run -c release vdisplay --width 1512 --height 950 --hidpi --preview
```

It uses its own serial number, so it can run beside the app.

## Caveats

- The display is built on CoreGraphics' private `CGVirtualDisplay` API,
  as DeskPad and BetterDisplay are. It cannot ship on the Mac App Store,
  and a macOS update could change it.
- It is not isolation. The virtual display shares your login session, so
  there is still one frontmost app, one keyboard focus and one pointer.
  Agents must use background input that leaves those alone.
